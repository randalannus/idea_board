## Setting up firebase (relevant links)
* [Add Firebase to your Flutter app](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup)
* [Get Started with Firebase Authentication on Flutter](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/flutter/start)

To compile the android app, you need to add a `google-services.json` file to `/android/app`. This is accomplished by running the `flutterfire configure` command.

You need to add your SHA1 key to firebase in order to use google sign-in.
